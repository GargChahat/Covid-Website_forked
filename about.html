<h2><u>About Coronavirus</u></h2>
Coronaviruses <big>(CoV)</big> are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases 
such as  <strong>Middle East Respiratory  Syndrome (MERS-CoV) </strong>and <strong>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)</strong>. 
Coronaviruses are <em>zoonotic</em>, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that
<strong>SARS-CoV</strong> was transmitted from civet cats
to humans and <strong>MERS-CoV</strong> from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not 
  yet infected humans.
<br><br>
A <i>novel coronavirus (nCoV)</i> is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
 Coronavirus disease <i>(COVID-19)</i> is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a 
contagious  disease caused by <strong>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</strong>.

were first reported by officials in<i> Wuhan City, China</i>,<i> in December 2019</i>. Retrospective investigations by 
Chinese authorities have  identified human cases with onset of symptoms in early <i>December 2019</i>.
While some of the earliest known cases had a link to a wholesale <em><big>food iet in Wuhan</big></em>, some did not.

<h2><u>Covid-19 Affect in India</u></h2>
 India, with a population of more than <i>1.34 billion</i>—the second largest population in the world—will have difficulty in 
 controlling the transmission of<strong> severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 </strong>among its population.
 A fragile and fragmented  healthcare system is buckling. Hospitals have been overwhelmed and have had to turn away scores of patients. 
 There aren’t enough beds. A complete<strong> lockdown</strong> was anounced on<i> 22 March 2021 </i>to curb the prevailing situation. It made the life of <strong>daily-meal earners hell</strong>, <strong>tourism industry clashed</strong>. <br>
